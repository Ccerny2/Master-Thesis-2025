# Construct Voter Distributions for Ohio Senate Districts, 2012-2022
To conduct election simulations, data from the Ohio Senate Districts for 2012 thru 2022 is used to construct voter distributions for each district to sample votes from. The variance, density, and median ideological score are used to infer likely distributions of voters by district. This methodology assumes the ideological preferences of a district electorate is reflected by the ideology of all the candidates who stand in elections, not just the winning candidate.

### Load & Prepare the data from DIME (Database on Ideology, Money in Politics, and Elections).

The DIME database includes all candidates and their corresponding ideological scores (`_cfscore_` & `_cfscores.dyn_`).

Subseting into the markers of interest. Namely, we are interested in all state senate candidates ("state:upper") corresponding to the Ohio General Assembly district map in use from 2012 to 2022. Additionally, candidates are ideologically grouped for the purposes of the analysis, with candidates from the GOP and Libertarian parties under the conservative ideology ;abel, and candidates from the Democrat and Green parties under the liberal ideology label.
```{r}
# Load DIME Data
load("C:/Corbin_Documents/Hertie, Class of 2026/Course Work/Theses/2024-25/Simulations/Ohio Distributions/DIME/dime_recipients_1979_2024.rdata")

# Subset to Ohio State Senate Candidates for 2012 thru 2022

cands_oh <- cands |> 
  filter(
    state == "OH",
    cycle >= 2012 & cycle <= 2022,
    seat == "state:upper",
    !is.na(recipient.cfscore.dyn)
  ) |> 
  mutate(
    district = ifelse(str_detect(district, "^OH-\\d+$"), district, paste0("OH-", district)), # Format
    ideological_block = case_when(
      party %in% c(100, 101) ~ "Liberal",       # Democrat, Green
      party %in% c(200, 201) ~ "Conservative",  # Republican, Libertarian
      TRUE ~ NA_character_
    )
  ) |> 
  filter(!is.na(ideological_block))  # Remove any unclassified parties

# Check distribution
table(cands_oh$ideological_block)

# Subset into individual senate districts

district_list <- setNames(
  lapply(1:33, function(i) {
    district_code <- paste0("OH-", i)
    cands_oh[cands_oh$district == district_code, ]
  }),
  paste0("oh", 1:33)
)

```
Statewide, we see that there are a greater number of conservative candidates who ran for state senate seats during the 2012-2022 period than liberal.

The variable _cfscore_ is the estimated ideology of a candidate/recipient while the variable _cfscores.dyn_ is the period-specific estimates of ideology. Under the _.dyn_ scoring, candidate/recipient scores are re-estimated in each election cycle while holding contributor scores constant.

- CFscore is a continuous measure of political ideology derived from campaign finance data
- Higher positive values = More Conservative
- Lower negative values = More Liberal
- 0 represents a centrist or moderate position.
- Candidates, donors, and organizations all receive CFscores, making it possible to compare their ideological positions directly.
- While there is no fixed range for CFscores, they typically fall within the -2 to +2 interval.

### Calculate Variance for Conservative & Liberal Voters Across State
The data we are interested in corresponds to the 2012-2022 General Assembly district map. This ten year period is inclusive of, on average, 3 state senate elections for each district, where odd number districts (ie. OH-1) and even number districts (ie. OH-2) oscillate holding elections every 2 years. This limits the amount of relevant data corresponding to the district map of interest to calculate the variance of each district. Therefore, the variance is calculated for the overall available data, that is, statewide for conservatives and liberals.
```{r}
# Compute variance and standard deviation
ideology_variance <- cands_oh |> 
  group_by(ideological_block) |> 
  summarise(
    variance = var(recipient.cfscore.dyn, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd = sd(recipient.cfscore.dyn, na.rm = TRUE),
    n = n()
  )

print(ideology_variance)

# Create Objects
sd_conservative <- ideology_variance$sd[ideology_variance$ideological_block == "Conservative"]
sd_liberal <- ideology_variance$sd[ideology_variance$ideological_block == "Liberal"]
```
The results indicate that liberal candidates statewide are more ideologically dispersed than conservative candidates, suggesting that Democratic/Green candidates vary more widely in their ideological positions than Republican/Liberatian candidates, who are more ideologically clustered.

### Calculate Median _cfscores.dyn_ For Conservative & Liberal By District
Calculations use the dynamic CFscore, `_cfscores.dyn_`,  which reflecrs the CFscore of each election cycle in the period of interest. The _.dyn_ scores of all conservative (GOP and Libertarian) and liberal (Democratic and Green) candidates who ran for office between 2012 and 2022 in each district are considered. The median is taken to compute an average ideological score for conservative and liberal voters in each district. Calculating the median within each group helps represent the core ideological stance of each party, even if a few candidates are outliers.
```{r}
# Create empty lists to store medians
median_conservative <- list()
median_liberal <- list()
district_names <- list()  # To store district names

# Loop through the list of districts
for (i in 1:33) {
  district_key <- paste0("oh", i)  # This is the list element name
  district_data <- district_list[[district_key]]  # Access the dataframe
  
  if (!is.null(district_data)) {
    district_names[[district_key]] <- paste0("OH-", i)

    # Compute medians for conservative (>0) and liberal (<0) candidates
    median_conservative[[district_key]] <- median(
      district_data$recipient.cfscore.dyn[district_data$recipient.cfscore.dyn > 0], na.rm = TRUE
    )
    median_liberal[[district_key]] <- median(
      district_data$recipient.cfscore.dyn[district_data$recipient.cfscore.dyn < 0], na.rm = TRUE
    )
  }
}

# Combine into one dataframe
district_medians <- data.frame(
  district = unlist(district_names),
  median_conservative = unlist(median_conservative),
  median_liberal = unlist(median_liberal)
)

```

*In OH-12, DIME is missing data on the lone democrat - Ken Poling who ran in 2020 - to run for state senate there during the whole period of interest (2012 thru 2022). No liberal candidate data exists for OH-12. Therefore, no median score can be calculated for OH-12 liberals.*

### Calculate Density For Conservative & Liberal By District
The share of votes captured in each election from 2012-2022 is used to determine the approximate share of each district electorate is conservative and liberal. The average conservative and liberal vote share is calculated by district using data from each election occurring during the period of interest. 
```{r}
# Load Data

*Note on the use of Softmax - The use of softmax in IRV, Borda, and Copeland is a design choice to model individual decision noise, reflecting probabilistic choice. These systems are used to select a single winner per district, where softmax helps simulate realistic uncertainty in voter preferences, without breaking the logic of the system. In multi-winner systems like STV, deterministic and valid full rankings of candidates are needed. Here, softmax introduces ambiguity that breaks the STV logic. Most academic and practitioner simulations of STV in the literature assume voters rank deterministically based on proximity (e.g., ideological distance), which guarantees valid ballots for the quota and elimination logic to work as intended.*

# Simulation - Single Transferable Vote With Multiple Winners

STV is used to determine a slate of winners for multi-winner elections (multi-member districts) rather than single winner (single-member districts), as is the case for plurality, IRV, Condorcet-Borda, and Copeland Round-Robin. Senate districts in Ohio comprise 3 House districts, each electing a single-member. In this simulation scenario, it is theorized that the single-member Senate districts are expanded to a 3-member district (a reflection of the current Senate-House district ratio) and STV is used to select multiple winners to fill the slate of representatives for each district.
